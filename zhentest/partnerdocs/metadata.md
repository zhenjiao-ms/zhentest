# Metadata #

There is a limited amount of metadata at the moment. 

Metadata can be specified at two places: at topic level and docset level

## 1. Topic-level metadata

In each topic, you can use YAML header to store metadata in Markdown file. It will be transformed to `yamlheader` tag when processed.

This format is already widely used in Github and will be rendered into a table in Github Markdown preview. 

Yaml header MUST be the first thing in the MD file and MUST take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. 

* All metadata labels should be in lower case.

Here are some examples:

```

title: Get Started

redirect_url: https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/
