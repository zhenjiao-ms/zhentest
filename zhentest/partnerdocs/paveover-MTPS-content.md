# Retiring your MTPS content (migration from MTPS to Open Publishing)

If you are migrating your content from MTPS (published with PWS or the Build Sytem) to Open Publishing, you will need to retire your old content, so it does not appear in the search engines. 

Steps:
1. Publish live your MTPS content as NoIndex/NoFollow. Once this is done, the old content will be removed from the site map in the next refresh (once every sprint). Remember to do this for all your locales you are moving to OP.
  * If your content is not removed from the site maps and still appear in the search results, open a bug via the [MSDNHelp portal](http://msdnhelp/) with the content ids, the locales, and when you retired your content. Provide the CMS you are using as well as the publishing list if you know.
2. Publish your OP content.
3. Apply 301 redirection from your MTPS content to the OP content. You can do that via CAPS or have our team do it for you. If choose the latter, please fill out a request via the [MSDNHelp portal](http://msdnhelp/).  Select the tile labelled **Library Support Request (formerly MSDNHelp@)**.  Under **Request type**, please select "Pave over/redirect obsolete topics". **Please make sure you fill out the template included at the top of the form and include it in your request.**
